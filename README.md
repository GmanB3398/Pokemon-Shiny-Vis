# Pokemon-Shiny-Vis
A Final Project for Wesleyan University's QAC 251. 

This project makes use of the PokeAPI under their fair use rules. Information about them can be found [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html).

To see the visualization, simply clone the repository and run the __app.R__ file which will open a local shiny session.
